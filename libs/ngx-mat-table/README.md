# NgxMatTable

This project provides a table component build upon Angular material table.

The `NgxMatTableComponent` does provide the capabilities to easily:
* render custom `ng-template`'s for columns
* A better default sorting by providing the possibility to define the sorting keys with dot-notation, e.g. Object.property.subProperty
* To easily hide and show columns dynamically

# Demo

# Version compatibility
